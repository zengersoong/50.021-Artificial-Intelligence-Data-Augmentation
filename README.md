#  Data Augmentation
Testing out Data Augmentations
Aim to find out what data augmentation, transform does to images
##### Comparing Data Augmentation on images, single crop, five crop and ten crop 
A. Single crop done manually without help of Pytorch Library
B. Five Crop using pytorch Library
C. Ten Cropt using pytorch Library

## Coursework Materials
###  Includes:
1. Using images from imagenet

### Deliverables . 
1. Utilising Data Class and dataloader . 
2. Comparing normalised and non normalised data
3. Comparing results with and without bilinear setting on PIl.images.
2. Manually process single crop on image . 
3. Compare the how well Data augmentation works with pre-trained models, resnet, densenet etc with single/five/ten crop
4. Try to classify a few images with two differentpretrained neural network architectures with an input size of 330x330

## Built With
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) - An open source deep learning platform that provides a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment.
* [imagenet](http://www.image-net.org/) - ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images.
